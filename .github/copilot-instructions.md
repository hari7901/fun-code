# SmartMail AI Project Instructions

This is a modern React TypeScript project for building a Smart Email Assistant landing page with the following architectural principles:

## Project Structure

- **Modular Architecture**: Components are organized by function (ui, sections, layout)
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed for better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with custom design system
- **Framer Motion**: Advanced animations and interactions
- **Production-Ready**: Scalable code structure following best practices

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces and types
- Follow component composition patterns
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Implement smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Maintain consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)

## Component Guidelines

- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Use proper prop typing with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper accessibility features
- Follow responsive design principles
- Use semantic HTML elements

## Animation Guidelines

- Use Framer Motion for complex animations
- Implement smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- Consider performance for animation-heavy components
- Use CSS animations for simple effects

## Design System

- Primary colors: Blue (600-700) and Purple (600-700)
- Typography: Inter font family
- Spacing: Tailwind's default spacing scale
- Custom gradients and smooth color transitions
- Glass morphism effects where appropriate
